        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Shrimp: Choose large shrimp (31 to 35 shrimp per pound) to get best
            results for this recipe. You can buy fresh shrimp and peel and
            devein it yourself, or buy frozen shrimp. Thaw frozen shrimp before
            using.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pasta: This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can
            substitute the pasta of your choice, like angel hair pasta,
            fettuccine, or spaghetti.
          </li>
          <li>
            Butter: Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the
            recipe.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extra-virgin olive oil: The flavor of the olive oil comes through in
            this recipe, so use the best quality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shallots and garlic: These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to
            shrimp scampi.
          </li>
          <li>
            White wine: Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce.
            Pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc are good choices, and you can drink
            the leftover wine with dinner. If you don't have a bottle to use,
            chicken stock or white whine vinegar make great substitutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lemon juice: Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seasonings: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper amplify the
            flavors, and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes give shrimp scampi a
            subtle kick. Use more red pepper flakes if you like things a bit
            more spicy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Parsley: Fresh parsley adds eye-catching color and a bright, peppery
            flavor.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Prep ahead: Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready to cook
            before heating your skillet. You don't want to have to pause to cut,
            chop, squeeze, or measure right in the middle of a fast-moving
            recipe. If using fresh shrimp, you can peel and devein the shrimp
            early in the day, then chill it in the refrigerator until you're
            ready cook.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook the pasta first: Boil the pasta in well-salted water, drain,
            and hold aside before cooking the shrimp scampi. You'll add the
            pasta to the hot skillet to warm it before serving. Time your
            cooking so you're ready to start cooking the shrimp immediately
            after the pasta is drained; you don't want the pasta to sit for too
            long.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't overcook the shrimp: It takes just a couple of minutes to cook
            raw shrimp, and if they cook for too long, shrimp turn tough and
            rubbery. You'll know the shrimp are close to done when they start to
            curl into a C shape and turn from translucent gray to opaque pink
            and white.
          </li>
        </ol>
