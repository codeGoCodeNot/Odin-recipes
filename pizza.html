        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
          <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
          <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            OVERNIGHT COLD RISE METHOD: In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in
            water. Stir in 2 cups of flour and salt; mix well. Stir in the
            remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each
            addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a
            lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 15
            minutes. Place dough in bowl dusted with flour cover with plastic
            wrap and refrigerate overnight.

            SPONGE RISE METHOD: In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup
            water. Stir in 1/2 cup of flour; mix well. Cover bowl with plastic
            wrap and let rise until foamy, about 1 hour. Blend in remaining
            water, flour and salt; beat well. When the dough has pulled
            together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until
            smooth and supple, about 15 minutes. Place dough in bowl dusted with
            flour and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled, about 2
            to 3 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.
            Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Roll dough out to half of
            its final size. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes (while you prepare
            desired pizza toppings). Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees
            C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Stretch out dough over your floured knuckles and spin/toss 2 to 3
            times until desired size is achieved. Place dough on a baker's peel
            sprinkled with cornmeal or a lightly greased pizza pan. Spread with
            desired toppings and bake on a pizza stone in preheated oven for 8
            to 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool for 5
            minutes before serving.
